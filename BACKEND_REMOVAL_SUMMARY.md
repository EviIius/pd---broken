## Current Status

🎯 **WORKING** - The application is now back to the stable, original layout that was working before the resizable layout implementation.

The chat assistant and document list are displayed side-by-side in a fixed layout that provides a reliable user experience without the complexity of dynamic resizing.

## Benefits of Reversion

- **Stability**: No layout breaking issues
- **Simplicity**: Clean, predictable interface
- **Proven**: Original design that was working well
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and debug

The core functionality (AI chat, document browsing, filtering) remains fully functional.
