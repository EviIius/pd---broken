# Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework for Banking Organizations

## Executive Summary

Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to banking organizations, their customers, and the broader financial system. This framework establishes comprehensive cybersecurity standards to protect customer information, ensure operational resilience, and maintain public confidence in the banking system.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirements

### Implementation Scope

Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for:

- All privileged access accounts (administrators, system operators)
- Customer-facing online banking systems
- Mobile banking applications
- Wire transfer and payment systems
- Remote access to internal systems

### Authentication Factors

Acceptable authentication factors include:

- **Something you know**: Passwords, PINs, security questions
- **Something you have**: Hardware tokens, mobile devices, smart cards
- **Something you are**: Fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition

### Implementation Standards

MFA implementation must meet the following standards:

- Minimum of two different factor types
- Time-based or event-based token generation
- Encrypted transmission of authentication data
- Regular review and update of authentication policies

## Network Segmentation

### Segmentation Requirements

Critical systems must be isolated through:

- Physical network separation where feasible
- Logical network segmentation using firewalls and VLANs
- Zero-trust network architecture principles
- Micro-segmentation for high-risk applications

### Critical System Isolation

The following systems require enhanced isolation:

- Core banking platforms
- Customer database systems
- Payment processing networks
- Regulatory reporting systems
- Backup and recovery infrastructure

### Access Controls

Network segmentation must include:

- Role-based access controls (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and recertification
- Automated provisioning and deprovisioning

## Incident Response Framework

### Response Phases

Incident response must include the following phases:

#### 1. Detection and Analysis
- Automated monitoring and alerting systems
- Security operations center (SOC) procedures
- Threat intelligence integration
- Initial impact assessment

#### 2. Containment
- Immediate containment strategies
- System isolation procedures
- Evidence preservation protocols
- Communication with stakeholders

#### 3. Eradication
- Root cause analysis
- Malware removal procedures
- System patching and updates
- Vulnerability remediation

#### 4. Recovery
- System restoration procedures
- Service resumption planning
- Monitoring for recurring issues
- Performance validation

#### 5. Lessons Learned
- Post-incident review process
- Documentation of lessons learned
- Policy and procedure updates
- Training program enhancements

### Incident Classification

Incidents must be classified by severity:

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to operations or customer data
- **High**: Significant impact on systems or potential data exposure
- **Medium**: Limited impact with contained scope
- **Low**: Minor incidents with minimal impact

## Vulnerability Management

### Assessment Requirements

Vulnerability assessments must be conducted:

- At least annually for all systems
- Quarterly for internet-facing systems
- After significant system changes
- Following security incidents

### Penetration Testing

Penetration testing requirements include:

- Annual testing by qualified third parties
- Testing of both internal and external networks
- Application security testing
- Social engineering assessments

### Remediation Standards

Critical vulnerabilities must be:

- Remediated within 30 days of identification
- Documented with remediation plans
- Verified through follow-up testing
- Escalated to senior management if not resolved

### Patch Management

Patch management procedures must include:

- Regular assessment of available patches
- Risk-based patch prioritization
- Testing procedures for critical patches
- Emergency patching procedures for zero-day vulnerabilities

## Third-Party Risk Management

### Vendor Security Assessments

Comprehensive vendor assessments must include:

- Security questionnaires and due diligence
- On-site security reviews for critical vendors
- Review of vendor security certifications
- Assessment of vendor incident response capabilities

### Cloud Service Provider Requirements

Cloud service providers must meet specific security standards:

- SOC 2 Type II compliance certification
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Geographic data residency controls
- Incident notification and reporting procedures

### Ongoing Monitoring

Third-party relationships require:

- Continuous security monitoring
- Regular security assessment updates
- Vendor security incident notification
- Contractual security requirements and SLAs

## Data Protection and Encryption

### Encryption Requirements

Data encryption standards include:

- Encryption of data at rest using AES-256 or equivalent
- Encryption of data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher
- Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- Full disk encryption for mobile devices

### Key Management

Encryption key management must include:

- Centralized key management systems
- Regular key rotation procedures
- Secure key storage and backup
- Role-based access to encryption keys

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

DLP programs must include:

- Classification of sensitive data
- Monitoring of data movement and access
- Prevention of unauthorized data transmission
- Regular review of data access patterns

## Breach Notification Requirements

### Customer Notification

Customer notification requirements include:

- Notification within 72 hours for personal information breaches
- Clear description of incident and impact
- Steps taken to address the incident
- Recommendations for customer protection

### Regulatory Notification

Regulatory notification must include:

- Immediate notification for significant incidents
- Detailed incident reports within specified timeframes
- Cooperation with regulatory examinations
- Implementation of recommended remediation measures

### Law Enforcement Coordination

Law enforcement coordination includes:

- Reporting of criminal activity
- Preservation of evidence
- Cooperation with investigations
- Information sharing within legal parameters

## Board and Senior Management Oversight

### Board Responsibilities

Board oversight includes:

- Quarterly cybersecurity briefings
- Annual review of cyber risk appetite
- Approval of cybersecurity policies and budgets
- Oversight of cybersecurity performance metrics

### Senior Management Responsibilities

Senior management must ensure:

- Implementation of board-approved policies
- Adequate resources for cybersecurity programs
- Regular assessment of cybersecurity risks
- Coordination with business continuity planning

### Reporting and Metrics

Cybersecurity reporting must include:

- Key risk indicators and performance metrics
- Incident trending and analysis
- Vulnerability management status
- Third-party risk assessment results

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training

Cybersecurity training must cover:

- Phishing and social engineering awareness
- Password security and MFA usage
- Incident reporting procedures
- Data handling and protection requirements

### Training Requirements

Training program requirements include:

- Annual mandatory training for all employees
- Role-specific training for IT and security personnel
- Regular updates based on emerging threats
- Competency testing and documentation

### Awareness Programs

Ongoing awareness programs include:

- Regular security awareness communications
- Simulated phishing exercises
- Security awareness campaigns
- Recognition programs for security-conscious behavior

## Conclusion

Effective cybersecurity risk management requires a comprehensive, multi-layered approach that addresses technology, processes, and people. Banking organizations must maintain robust cybersecurity frameworks to protect against evolving threats and ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system.
